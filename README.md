# QuickLoanPrediction - Loan Approver Using Spring BOOT and H2O AutoML [Rule Based To ML Based Loan Prediction]

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a loan approval application built using **Spring Boot** and **H2Oâ€™s AutoML**. The goal of the application is to predict whether a loan should be approved and what interest rate should be offered. The system makes use of **Gradient Boosting Models** for binary classification and regression tasks based on the provided dataset. 

Here are the key features of the application:

1. **ML as a service using Spring Boot**
2. **Dockerize ML model + REST API**
3. **Polygot programming model**: Loan Approver model & interest calculation is written in **Python/R**
4. **Model stored as POJO (Plain Old Java Object)**

Note: This project showcases the integration of machine learning with **Spring Boot** as a REST API. It allows rolling out new versions of the model seamlessly and performing A/B testing in real-time production systems.

The architecture of the Loan Approver application allows:
1. **Programmers** to use their preferred programming languages (Python/R) and frameworks.
2. **Ease of production deployment** through Dockerization.
3. **Seamless integration of ML models as REST APIs using Spring Boot** for real-time prediction.

This architecture style is useful for multiple use cases, including:
- Health insurance fraud detection
- ePayment card fraud detection
- Retail (eCommerce) inventory optimization
- And more...

## Loan Approver Application Overview

The **QuickLoanPrediction** system is a smart application that uses machine learning to decide whether a loan should be approved. It consists of two predictive models:

- **Loan Approval Model**: Predicts whether the loan is a bad loan (yes/no)
- **Interest Rate Model**: Predicts the interest rate if the loan is approved.

The model is created following these steps:

- Step 1: Prepare the model to answer the prediction question.
- Step 2: Use relevant data to create the model.
- Step 3: Export the model as a Java POJO.
- Step 4: Compile the Java model using Gradle.
- Step 5: Deploy the model using **Spring Boot** on **Tomcat**.
- Step 6: Expose the model as a REST API along with dependent variables, and provide a Swagger UI for testing.
